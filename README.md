# Threads

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **Threads** of class **operating systems 1,** written in Python (2.7) with my two team members [Korbinian Karl](https://github.com/korbster) and [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
This assignment was one of my first steps working with Python. To complete this assignment we had to write a program that works with a global variable, creates 10 threads which every single one does 1000 loops. Five of the 10 threads add `1` to the global variable, the other five subtract `1`. The main thread which creates the 10 threads waits for all threads to join and prints **Thread Nr. X joined** to the screen where **X** stands for one of the 10 threads. After all the program should print the value of the global variable to the screen.
